## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in this quantum zero-knowledge proof implementation, please follow responsible disclosure practices.

### How to Report

**For security vulnerabilities, please do NOT create a public GitHub issue.**

Instead, please report security issues privately to:

**Security Contact:** Nicolas Cloutier
**Email:** ncloutier@hydraresearch.io
**Subject:** [SECURITY] Quantum ZKP Vulnerability Report

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your security report:

1. **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
2. **Impact**: Potential security impact and affected components
3. **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
4. **Proof of Concept**: Code or demonstration (if applicable)
5. **Suggested Fix**: Proposed solution (if you have one)
6. **Disclosure Timeline**: Your preferred disclosure timeline

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours of report
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Within 7 days
- **Fix Development**: Timeline depends on severity
- **Public Disclosure**: Coordinated with reporter

### Security Considerations

This implementation deals with cryptographic security, so we pay special attention to:

#### Critical Security Areas

1. **Information Leakage**: Ensuring zero-knowledge property is maintained
2. **Soundness**: Preventing proof forgery attacks
3. **Post-Quantum Security**: Resistance to quantum computer attacks
4. **Side-Channel Attacks**: Timing, memory, and other side channels
5. **Implementation Security**: Buffer overflows, injection attacks, etc.

#### Known Security Features

- **Zero Information Leakage**: Proven through comprehensive testing
- **Configurable Soundness**: 32-256 bit security levels
- **Post-Quantum Cryptography**: Dilithium signatures, quantum-resistant hashes
- **Secure Random Generation**: Cryptographically secure randomness
- **Memory Safety**: Go's memory safety features

### Security Testing

We maintain comprehensive security testing including:

- **Information Leakage Analysis**: Automated detection of secret exposure
- **Soundness Verification**: Mathematical proof validation
- **Performance Security**: Timing attack resistance
- **Fuzzing**: Input validation and edge case testing
- **Static Analysis**: Code security scanning

### Security Updates

Security updates will be:

1. **Prioritized**: Security fixes take precedence over features
2. **Tested**: Thoroughly tested before release
3. **Documented**: Clear changelog and impact assessment
4. **Coordinated**: Responsible disclosure timeline followed

### Acknowledgments

We appreciate security researchers who help improve the security of quantum cryptographic systems. Responsible disclosure helps protect all users.
