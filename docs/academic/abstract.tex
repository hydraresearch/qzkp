This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of quantum zero-knowledge proofs, exploring their theoretical foundations, practical implementations, and potential applications in secure communication. We examine the unique advantages offered by quantum properties such as superposition and entanglement in constructing more efficient and secure zero-knowledge protocols. Our work contributes to the growing body of research in post-quantum cryptography and provides insights into the practical challenges of implementing quantum zero-knowledge proofs in real-world scenarios.
